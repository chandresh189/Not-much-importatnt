DBMS 
query- doesnt start with any vowel
answer-
 SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION 
 WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[^aeiou]';


(gourav - in this the inner one is for negation and outer for the search with the beginning letter)


The first ^ is to make it match the beginning of the String.
The second ^ is negation. You need both to work.

If you just did [^aeiou] it would be strings without aeiou. 
You need the extra ^ in ^[^aeiou] to make sure to match 
strings that dont BEGIN with aeiou.
