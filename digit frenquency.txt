Given a string, S, consisting of alphabets and digits,
find the frequency of each digit in the given string

```
//Frequency of digits
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    char a[1000];
    int c,num[10] = {0};
    cin>>a;
    for(int i = 0 ;i <= strlen(a);i++)
    {
        if(isdigit(a[i]) > 0)
        {
            c = (a[i]) - '0';
            num[c] += 1;
        }
    }
    for(int i = 0; i<10;i++)
    {
        cout<<num[i]<<" ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
look first of all we have to check weather a[i] is a digit or not (using isdigit() we are doing this) after that, …suppose a[i] found to be a digit let say 9 but remember 9 is currently a string ‘9’ which is actually 57 in ascii, so we know that ‘0’ is 48 when we do c= (a[i])-‘0’
that is actually c= 57-48 = 9 so we will increase value at the position 9 to have a record.

INPUT-lw4n88j12n1
OUTPUT- 0 2 1 0 1 0 0 0 2 0
in this we got 4 once so a[4] = 1 and 8 twice so a[8] = 2
