question:

Sample Input
6
1 4 6 2 8 9
2
2 4

Sample Output
3
1 8 9
Explanation

The first query is to erase the 2nd element in the vector, which is 4.
 Then, modifed vector is {1 6 2 8 9}, we want to remove the range of 2~4, 
which means the 2nd and 3rd elements should be removed.
 Then 6 and 2 in the modified vector are removed and we finally get {1 8 9}
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{

int n;
cin >> n;
vector< int> v(n);
for(int i =0; i < n; i ++)
 {
    cin >> v[i];//taken
 }
 int x,a,b;
 cin>>x>>a>>b;
 v.erase( v.begin() + x-1 );
 /*erasing the xth number its -1 bc indexing starts from 0 and therefore it was extra*/

  /*for(auto x:v)
    cout << x << " ";*/

 v.erase(v.begin()+a-1,v.begin()+b-1);
 //earasing from  A to B removing the index 0 thus a-1 and b-1
 cout<<v.size()<<endl;
 for(auto x:v)
    cout << x << " ";

return 0;
