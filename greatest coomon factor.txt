C++ inbuilt function for finding GCD

In many competitive programming problems, we need to find greatest common divisor also known as gcd. Euclids algorithm to find gcd has been discussed here

C++ has the built-in function for calculating GCD. This function is present in header file.
Syntax:

 __gcd(m, n) 
Parameter :  m, n
Return Value :  0 if both m and n are zero, 
else gcd of m and n.

// CPP program to illustrate 
// gcd function of C++ STL 

#include <iostream> 
#include <algorithm>  
  
using namespace std; 
  
int main() 
{ 
    cout << "gcd(6, 20) = " << __gcd(6, 20) << endl; 
} 
Output:


output;
gcd(6, 20) = 2
